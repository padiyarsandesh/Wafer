# wafer-fault-detection
* Built a classification methodology to predict the quality of wafer sensors based on the given training data.
* The inputs of various sensors for different wafers have been provided. 
* In electronics, a wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used for the fabrication of integrated circuits.
* The goal was to build a machine learning model which predicts whether a wafer needs to be replaced or not (i.e., whether it is working or not) based on the inputs from various sensors.
* A complete pipelined architecture was used as shown below.
